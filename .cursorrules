# Instructions

During you interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again.

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2
Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Do not modify a feature that is not in the user's prompt.

## Cursor learned

- For website image paths, always use the correct relative path (e.g., 'images/filename.png') and ensure the images directory exists
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using constants in a file, make sure to import all required constants from the constants file to avoid reference errors
